3. **Disable Semantic Index (Critical)**
   ```
   Initial Prompt Template:
   "Please analyze only the content of this specific document. Do not use any external knowledge or semantic index from other documents. Base your responses solely on what is written in this document. If information is not present in this document, please clearly state that."
   ```

4. **Document Interaction Examples**
   ```
   Query Examples:
   - "Summarize the main points of this document"
   - "What are the key recommendations mentioned?"
   - "Find all instances where [specific term] is mentioned"
   - "Extract the action items from this document"
   - "What is the conclusion of this document?"
   - "Create a bullet point summary of each section"
   ```

### Step 4: Using Copilot with Presentations in PowerPoint

1. **Open Presentation**
   - Access PowerPoint Online or Desktop application
   - Open target presentation from OneDrive/SharePoint
   - Ensure all slides are loaded and accessible

2. **Copilot Interaction**
   - Click Copilot icon in PowerPoint ribbon
   - Use the semantic index disabling prompt as shown above
   - Interact with presentation content:
     ```
     PowerPoint-Specific Queries:
     - "Summarize each slide in this presentation"
     - "What are the key messages across all slides?"
     - "Find slides that mention [specific topic]"
     - "Extract all data points from charts and graphs"
     - "What is the flow of information in this presentation?"
     ```

### Step 5: Using Copilot with Spreadsheets in Excel

1. **Open Workbook**
   - Launch Excel Online or Desktop
   - Open target workbook containing data
   - Ensure all worksheets are accessible

2. **Excel Copilot Interaction**
   - Access Copilot through Excel ribbon
   - Apply semantic index disabling prompt
   - Query spreadsheet data:
     ```
     Excel-Specific Queries:
     - "Analyze the data in this spreadsheet"
     - "What trends do you see in the data?"
     - "Calculate the total for column [X]"
     - "Find the highest/lowest values in this dataset"
     - "Explain what this data represents"
     ```

### Step 6: Advanced Document Interaction Techniques

1. **Focused Analysis Queries**
   ```

   - Use clear, direct language in your questions
   - Reference specific sections or pages when relevant
   - Ask follow-up questions to drill down into details

2. **Semantic Index Management**
   - Always start sessions with the semantic index disabling prompt
   - Remind Copilot to focus on document content if responses seem too broad
   - Verify that responses are based on document content, not external knowledge

3. **Response Validation**
   - Cross-reference Copilot responses with actual document content
   - Look for page numbers or section references in responses
   - Ask for specific citations when needed: "Where in the document does it mention this?"

### Step 8: Troubleshooting Common Issues

1. **Copilot Not Available**
   - Verify Copilot licensing is active
   - Check that document is stored in OneDrive/SharePoint
   - Ensure latest version of Office applications
   - Clear browser cache if using web applications

2. **Responses Include External Information**
   - Restate the semantic index disabling prompt
   - Be more explicit: "Answer based only on this document's content"
   - Ask for specific page or section references in responses

3. **Limited Response Quality**
   - Ensure document text is selectable (not image-based)
   - Check document formatting for accessibility
   - Try rephrasing questions in different ways
   - Break complex queries into smaller, specific questions

### Step 9: Integration with Teams and Collaboration

1. **Sharing Insights**
   - Copy Copilot responses to share with team members
   - Use @mentions to reference specific team members
   - Create follow-up documents based on Copilot analysis

2. **Collaborative Document Review**
   ```
   Team Collaboration Prompts:
   - "What questions would a new team member have about this document?"
   - "What are the most important points for [specific role/department]?"
   - "Create a discussion agenda based on this document"
   - "What actions items should we track from this document?"
   ```

### Step 10: Compliance and Security Considerations

1. **Data Handling**
   - Understand that Copilot processes document content through Microsoft's AI services
   - Ensure compliance with organizational data handling policies
   - Consider document classification levels when using Copilot

2. **Audit and Monitoring**
   - Monitor Copilot usage through Microsoft 365 admin center
   - Review audit logs for document access and AI interactions
   - Ensure usage aligns with organizational AI usage policies
