    F --> G[AI Response Generation]
    G --> H[Formatted Response]
    H --> I[User Interface]
```

1. User submits natural language query through the copilot interface
2. Copilot Studio processes the query using built-in AI capabilities
3. System identifies relevant data sources and retrieves information
4. AI engine generates contextual response based on retrieved data
5. Formatted response is presented to the user
